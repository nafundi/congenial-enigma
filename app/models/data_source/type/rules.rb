# This module includes functionality for accessing the data source type's list
# of supported rules. An alert associated with a data source can be triggered
# only by one of the supported rules of the data source's type. For example, a
# rule designed to evaluate something ODK-specific cannot be applied to incoming
# data from another data source type.
#
# We can distinguish between a rule type -- represented by a rule class -- and a
# fully parameterized rule, which is represented by a rule object. The word
# "rule" can refer to either concept, similar to how the word "filter" can mean
# either a filtering process or an application of such a process. However, this
# module is concerned solely with rule types: you shoud read references to
# "supported rules" as having to do with rule types. That said, in general,
# unless specified otherwise, the term "rule" usually refers to a parameterized
# rule: the app uses rule types in fewer places.
#
# An Alert object validates that its rule type is supported by the alert's
# associated data sources, and it also validates its rule object in other ways.
